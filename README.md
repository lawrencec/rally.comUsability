Rally.comUsability
========

A simple greasemonkey[1] script for Firefox and Chrome that adds a couple of things to rally.com to make it
a little bit more usable. 

Currently:

 * Adds a relevant document title to every page (as opposed to just 'Rally') thereby 
   making navigation between tabs and through history much more easier.
 * Make all links that have a target of _blank to _self so that the user can decide
   whether to open the link in a new tab/window.
